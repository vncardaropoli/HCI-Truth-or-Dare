# HCI-Truth-or-Dare

My idea is an app that facilitates a common party game, truth or dare. Have you ever wanted to play truth or dare but you and your friends are not creative enough to come up with your own ideas? This app will make the game easier, while still being fun. This app would let you select multiple themes to play with all of the different questions in the themes. The intended users are typically college-aged students but can be played by any demographic. The main task that this app will do is offer randomly selected truth or dare questions to facilitate an in-person game. The users will decide what categories they want to play, start the game, and then go through each turn indicating if they want a question or a dare.
